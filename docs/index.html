    The original did a good job of having a map layout and labeling the ranks for each state.   It also made a list of the top and bottom five states.

    <br>
    However, the use of colors did not effectively correspond with rank.  Furthermore, the most recent year in the spreadsheet is 2016, where the graphic says 2018.

    <br>
    The dataset includes many metrics, but does not accurately explain what they represent, nor how they are used to calculate "Overall Rank".  I changed the color scale to a single color with 5 steps.
